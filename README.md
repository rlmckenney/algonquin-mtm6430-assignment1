# Code examples: List / Detail View
**Algonquin College MTM6430 - Web Applications**

This repo shows several examples of the solution to Assignment #1 (List/Detail View) using AngularJS and Bootstrap.

The [controller-logic](https://github.com/rlmckenney/algonquin-mtm6430-assignment1/tree/controller-logic) branch shows the simplest solution building on previous in-class examples. All the logic is in a single `app.js` file with the data access functions duplicated in each controller.

The [movie-db-service](https://github.com/rlmckenney/algonquin-mtm6430-assignment1/tree/movie-db-service) branch shows how we can extract the data access logic into a service object that can then be injected into the controllers as needed. This gives us a single place to maintain the implementation logic for accessing our datasource.  This is much cleaner to read and maintain.

The [custom-components](https://github.com/rlmckenney/algonquin-mtm6430-assignment1/tree/custom-components) branch shows the final version (which has been merged into the main `dev` and `master` branches) where we implemented custom components and more closely follow the best practices for code organization in a larger project. This becomes a good reference template.

You will find that this final version is heavily documented throughout the code to explain what each function and angular directive is doing.
